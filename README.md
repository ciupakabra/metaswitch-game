Project H: Finding Technical Talent

A software telecoms company are looking for ways to attract and identify new technical talent.
They’re looking for some kind of game or puzzle that will run in a web browser, with twin underlying
goals of (a) get lots of students interested in and applying to the company and (b) automatically
flagging any particularly good looking candidates to the company to fast-track to interview. The
company has some ideas for puzzles and games that might work, but are open to ideas and
suggestions from the consultants (you!) – they’re really looking for something with wow factor.
There’s no restriction on the set of languages/packages/back-end that you use. [Project in
collaboration with Metaswitch]
